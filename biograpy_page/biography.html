                <P>
                Born October 15, 1938 in Abeokuta, Nigeria and died August 2, 1997 in Lagos Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, 
                also named Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti is Nigerian musician and activist who pioneered a modern style of music called Afro-beat, 
                which fused the traditional Yoruba music, Jazz, American blues, and funk. <br> <br>
                Being a young enthusiastic person, Fela would run for miles to go to conventional celebrations within the range, 
                as of now feeling that the true African culture of his precursors need to be protected. 
                His parents sent him to London in 1958, but instead of studying medicine like his two brothers and his sister, 
                Fela chose to enroll within the Trinity School of Music, where he was to spend another five long year. 
                During his time as a student(aged 23), Fela married a Nigerian girl called Remi and they both had three children. <br> <br>
                The anti-Fela sentiment within the government reached a new peak at this time, 
                prompting him to establish his own political party in 1979 - the Movement of the People(MOP), 
                and was unsuccessful during his run for the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 
                Five years afterward he was imprisoned for 20 months on charges of smuggling money. 
                He turned away from dynamic politics upon his discharge from prison. 
                His child, Femi, was left to carry the burn of Afro-beat music. Fela was imprisoned once more in 1993 for killing, 
                but the charges were inevitably dropped. He passed on as a result of complications from AIDs-related illness at the age of 58.
