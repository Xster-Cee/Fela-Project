            <h1>Songs</h1>
            <p>FEla, as he was universally known, decided in the late 1960s that he had no use for love songs or party tunes; he wanted to 
               challenge unjust authority. He battled Nigeria’s government, which repeatedly had him beaten and imprisoned. 
               His music, Afrobeat — not to be confused with Afrobeats, the computer-driven pop-R&B currently emerging from Nigeria 
               and across Africa — steered his knowledge of American funk and jazz back toward African modes and rhythms.
